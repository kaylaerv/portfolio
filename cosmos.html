                <h1>Cosmos Day Tours Website & Branding</h1>
                <p>Cosmos Day Tours, a touring company needed a website that would allow it's audience to learn about the newfound company and book tours online. They wanted to demonstrate that they provide tours to only the best sustainable wineries that have friendly and knowledgeable employees. They wanted to appeal not only to people new to the wine touring experience but also people who are wine connoisseurs. They give tours to families and people of all ages; They even do tours that aren't about wine.</p>

                <p class="spacer-16">It was essential from the beginning to understand Cosmos Day Tours' mission and target audience. We wanted to appeal primarily to tourists between the ages of 30-40 who have money to indulge on weekend tours. The mission of Cosmos Day Tours was "To provide tourist and locals, safe and reliable transportation to wineries, farms, and breweries. To lead the shuttle and tour industry in sustainable, clean air methods of operation."</p>
                <p class="spacer-16">To start off, the client took my colleagues and I on a wine touring experience early on so that we could better understand what the company and it's services. We experienced 3 different wineries and got a good sense of the atmosphere of the wineries and the people who visited them.</p>
                <p class="spacer-32">I researched 5 wine touring companies to see what opportunities we could set Cosmos Day Tours apart from the rest.</p>

                <p>The client was very happy with the website design and asked for my help with the new Cosmos Day Tours logo and other branding materials. I would have liked to have had time to be able to do more research of the target audience; Learning directly from them about their needs, wants, and pain points would have been beneficial to the process.</p>

                <h2 class="spacer-32">Logo Process</h2>
                <p class="spacer-16">I was happy to be able to create the Cosmos Day Tours logo, but unfortunately the project was started after the website design. I wish it would have been first, but I did my best to apply all I had learned from designing the website to designing the logo.</p>
                <p class="spacer-72">The logo is a representation of the cosmos flower as a compass, which symbolizes adventure and new experiences. The logo is simplistic while portraying Cosmos Day Tours as luxurious and professional, yet friendly and inviting.</p>
